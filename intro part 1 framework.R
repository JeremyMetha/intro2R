# setting up

setwd() # first, let's decide where our r stuff should end up.


# using r as a calculator

# comparisons

# troubleshooting 101!


#####
# Challenge 1: Basic Driving

#   a) Basic calculator time! Run the following in the CONSOLE:
#   32*19 + 123,
#   what do you get?

#   b) Run the following in a SCRIPT: 11*34 + log(10
#   What happens? Do you get a value? Error? Warning?
#   Can you fix it?
#   c) Which one is larger, 34^4 or 1e6? Can you write an
#   expression to solve this?
#####


# functions


#####
# Challenge 2: Functions and Help

#   a) What does the abs() function do? Access help.
#      What is abs(-10)

#   b) What is the square root of 11? Is there a function for this in R?

#   c) How can we round numbers in R? Round 3.5 to the nearest integer.
#      Is it 3 or 4?
#####

# variables and storing data

# names can contain
# letters
# numbers
# underscores
# periods

#names can't
# contain spaces
# start with a number or underscore

# names are case sensitive

#####
# Challenge 3: Variables and Storing Data

#   a) Try assigning some variables to these names. Which of the following work as names?
# min_height
# _age
# .mass
# MaxLength
# maxLength
# 2widths

#   b) What will be the value of each variable below after each step?
# height <- 181.2
# weight <- 85
# height <- height ^2
# weight <- sqrt(weight) + height/2
#####

# managing your environment




# vectors

#####
## Challenge 4: Vectors

#   a) Create a vector with these numbers:
#      1, 11, 111, 1111

#   b) What is the square root of each of the numbers in A?
#      Store these as another vector.

#   c) Create a vector with the name of each person on your table.

# expanding r with packages

#####
## Challenge 5: Packages

# Install the tidyverse package onto your machines, then check if it's there and behaving using the library() function.
