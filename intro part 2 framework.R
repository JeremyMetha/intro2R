# Hierarchy:   logical -> integer -> numeric -> complex -> character

# Which of these coercion work? What do they produce? Why might this be the case?

# Challenge 2: Vectors

# Create the following vectors in R. What are their data types?
c(TRUE,1L,10)
c("11",10,12)


# Create a vector that ranges from 10 to 50 in steps of 3 (use the seq() function)
#   How many elements are in the vector?
#   What is the value of the 7th element in the vector?
#   Replace the 10th element in the vector with twice itâ€™s current value
#   How can you access the last 8 elements of the vector? Try finding two alternative ways.
#   Advanced: what is the sum of all the elements except the first 3          elements?
#   The sum() function might help here..

# Challenge 3: Lists

# Create a named list called winter with the following elements:
#   A logical named too_damn_cold with value TRUE
#   A vector named better.temperatures with the values 24, 25 and 26
#   Change the third better temperature to 30 (that is, change 26 to 30) by reassigning it

# Challenge 4: Dataframes

# Our cats need to be put on the fancy square root diet, for Garfield's sake.
# Modify the weight column such that each cat loses the square root of their starting weight
# Through the power of positive influence from his peers, Garfield no longer hates Mondays.
# Modify his hates_mondays value to reflect this.
